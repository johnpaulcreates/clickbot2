when ie starts, it searches the registerty to find stuf it needs to load
all BHO's must implement the IObjectWithSite interface:

Private Sub IObjectWithSite_GetSite(ByVal priid As VBShellLib.REFIID, ppvObj As VBShellLib.VOID)
  '
End Sub

Private Sub IObjectWithSite_SetSite(ByVal pSite As VBShellLib.IUnknownVB)
  '
End Sub

there is a class in this solution that defines this interface (IObjectWithSite.vb)


How do we attach to IE?
wehn the bho is first loaded, SetSite will be called and a reference to the browser will be passed via pSite
WE need to store this reference and convert it to an InternetExplorer object (which uses the IWebBrowser2 interface)

Add References to these COM Libraries:
* Microsoft HTML OBject Library
* Microsoft Internet Controls

Include system.windows.forms to get the messagebox class



after compilation, register teh dll:
regasm /codebase whatever.dll
(use the visual studio command prompt, might need to run as admin.  remember to enclose he path in quotes)

now the addin shoul dbe registered with IE.  you might have to enable it in there.
